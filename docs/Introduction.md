# Audit Protocol

This document describes some of the concepts and details the services of the Audit protocol.
It is highly recommended to use the dockerized installation to run the project instead of manually running all the services.

## Introduction

The project consists of only following service now:
* [Payload Commit](#payload-commit)

## Glossary of Key Terms

### **Project**
  1. A project in audit-protocol corresponds to each pair contractâ€™s (like UNISWAPV2) DAG chain.
  2. Each snapshot is specific to a project

### **EpochID**
  1. EpochID represents identifier for each generated epoch, stored on the smart contract.
  2. EpochID starts with 1 for the first epoch and increments by 1 for each epoch, when contract is deployed.
  3. Size of each epoch is configured on the smart contract.

# Services Details

## Payload Commit

The payload commit service has following high level functionalities:
1. Listens on rabbitmq snapshot generated events.
2. Store the snapshot on IPFS and/web3.storage (based on configuration).
    - stores cid from IPFS and web3.storage on redis cache for given project at provided epochID.
3. Creates EIP-712 based structured data hash and generated signature.
4. Submits the signature to the relayer (if configured) otherwise submits snapshot to smart contract.
5. Listens for snapshot finalization event on rabbitmq
   - if finalized snapshot for a given project against an epochId has same snapshotCID as stored on redis cache, don't do anything.
   - if finalized snapshotCID is different, replace redis cached snapshotCID with finalized snapshotCID.

Code for this service is located at [payload-commit](../go/payload-commit/)

## Code Structure

### Golang Code
Golang Code is present in [go](../go/) folder and has been structured as below.
Common utils that are used by multiple Golang services are available in [goutils](../go/goutils/).
 Below are list of utils
- [caching](../go/caching) - Generic caching interface
- [logger](../go/goutils/logger/) - Logger initialization and setup code
- [redisutils](../go/goutils/redisutils/) - Redis client initialization and common operations wrapper code
- [settings](../go/goutils/settings/) - Parsing the settings and settings deaults
- [slackutils](../go/goutils/slackutils/) - Code to interact with slack workflow
- [datamodel](../go/goutils/datamodel/) - Data models used across services
- [ipfsutils](../go/goutils/ipfsutils/) - IPFS client initialization and common functionality
- [w3s](../go/goutils/w3s/) - Web3 storage client initialization and common functionality
- [health](../go/goutils/health/) - Health check listener
- [taskmgr](../go/goutils/taskmgr/) - Generic interface for task manager presently only has rabbitmq task manager
- [smartcontract](../go/goutils/smartcontract/) - Smart contract api

Following services are written in Golang
