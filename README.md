#### Options
- "max_ipfs_blocks": This number represents the latest max_ipfs_blocks need to fetched using ipfs_client
- "max_pending_payload_commits": This variable is not yet used anywhere. This variable represents the limit at which, 
you need to block further calls to the commit_payload endpoint. Once the pending_payload_commits Queue reach a certain 
limit, it needs to be alerted.
- "block_storage": Either IPFS to FILECOIN. This variable represents where each of the block or payload needs to be stored
- "payload_storage": Same as that of the block_storage
- "container_height": The no.of DAG blocks each container needs to hold.
- "backup_target": Defaults to FILECOIN for now. This variable represents where we want to backup the containers


# Powerloom-protocol

Audit data by snapshotting payloads. Keep track of changes for each successive payload committed. 
Proof for the state for each payload at a particular time is represented by the transaction hash 
generated by committing the payload Cid to a smart contract. Each payload Cid is also wrapped up 
in a DAG structure, and each DAG structure houses the cid of the previous DAG, along with the
transaction hash for the payload and timestamp at which that payload was committed.

Run the docker:
```
cd docker/
make powerloom
```

Try to commit some payload:
```shell
curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9000/commit_payload' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
--data-raw '{
  "payload": {
      "test_field_a": "put any kind data here",
      "test_field_b": {
          "key_a": [1, 2],
          "key_b": 5000
      }
  },
  "projectId": "test_project_1"
}

```
The response you get should be:
```shell
{
    "cid": "QmQa7YZLitKkcMwRmZnx93wSEYjmtUxZgfdMJ1TQwSxgDa",
    "tentativeHeight": 1,
    "payloadChanged": true
}
```

The are 3 fields in the above body:

- cid: This represents the content-identifier for the payload committed. It is a unique
hash for the payload field.
  
- tentativeHeight: Every new payload committed will have height that represents its position
in the chain of payloads committed. However tentativeHeight is not a deterministic value. If
  the proof for this payload is not recieved in the backend, the payload is discarded.
  
- payloadChanged: Represents whether the payload has changed from previous commit or not
